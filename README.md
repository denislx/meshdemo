# meshdemo

## OCI mesh stuff getting done here.

This OCI Service Mesh microservices example has two home versions that is configured as home v1 and v2 and load routed 50-50 between them. Only home v2 calls the price component for JSON data.
Services and Mesh (re)deployment is done from OCI DevOps.
